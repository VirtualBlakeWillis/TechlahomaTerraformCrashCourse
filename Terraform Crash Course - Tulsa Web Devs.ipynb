    "### IaC? Terraform?\n",
    "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through manual processes. By using code and software to automate the infrastructure creation process, you can reduce errors in redeploying infrastructure, leverage tools like git for version control, and eliminate configuration drift. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just to note, Terraform is not the only Infrastructure as Code tool available. There are other existing tools such as Pulumi, Crossplane, Ansible, and others. All of them come with their own pros and cons. Some cloud providers have their own cloud-specific Infrastructure as Code tool. AWS has CloudFormation and Azure has Bicep (which is probably the coolest IaC tool name ever). Bt these tools only work within a specific cloud environment. If you are working with multi-cloud environments, you might be better off using an IaC tool like Ansible, Pulumi, or Terraform. \n",
    "\n",
    "### But What About Open Tofu?\n",
    "OpenTofu is a fork of Terraform project maintained by The Linux Foundations Project since HashiCorp (the creator of Terraform) switched the license of Terraform from an open-source license to a source available license. If you'd rather use OpenTofu instead of Terraform, you should be able to follow along with this tutorial. Just replace `terraform` with `tofu` when running your terminal commands."

    "## Installing Terraform \n",
    "### MacOS\n",

    "brew tap hashicorp/tap\n",
    "brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows\n",
    "Installing Terraform on Windows OS is also pretty simple if you have the package manager Chocolatey. Install it via chocolatey by using the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "choco install terraform\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linux\n",
    "If you are using a Linux distro, follow the directions at this [link here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) to install.\n",
    "*Note: These directions work for those who are using a Chromebook as well. Just follow the Debian installation instructions after activating Linux mode.*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check if the installation worked by running the `terraform -version` command in your terminal."

    "## Write the Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can start deploying our infrastructure to cloud providers, we must write the plan. Every Terraform project needs to have a `main.tf` file. You can place all of your Terraform code in this file. But it is generally best practice to separate related infrastructure into separate files and within the main.tf file to only declare your required providers and backend references within the Terraform block.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, there are two important parts of the Terraform block: the `backend` and `required providers`. The backend block contains information about where the state of your infrastructure is stored. The state is a document that contains a record of what infrastructure is currently deployed. This helps us see the discrepancies between what is written in the plan and what is currently deployed. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be using the `local` backend, which is simply a reference to a file on your local computer. Tjere are many other backends you can use to store the state of your infrastructure, including: Azure Blob Storage (azurerm), Consul Key/Value store (consul), Tencent Cloud Object Storage (cos), Google Cloud Storage (gcs), REST API Client (http), Kubernetes secret (kubernetes), Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (oss), Postgres database (pg), and Amazon S3 (s3). To learn more about the available backend configurations, [click here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/configuration). \n",
    "\n",
    "The provider block allows you to include modules into your project. The most common use of modules is for provisioning resources in specific cloud providers. You can find the list of available modules at [registry.terraform.io](https://registry.terraform.io/). \n"

    "Terraform plans consist of five primary block types: `variable` blocks, `data` blocks, `resource` blocks, `local` blocks, and `output` blocks. We will explore four of the five block types in this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variable blocks allow for you to customize the behavior of your modules without having to directly edit the plan. There are six optional parameters you can set when declaring a variable block: `type`, `description`, `default`, `validation`, `sensitive` and `nullable`.The `type` parameter indicates the type of data stored in the variable. There are six types in Terraform: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `map` (or object), `list`, and `set`. The `description` is where you can provide a helpful description of what the variable is supposed to be for. The `default` parameter determines what the variable will be if the value is not defined elsewhere. The `validation` parameter allows you to define specific requirements a variable value must be. The `sensitive` parameter allows you to hide sensitive variables from being stored in the state. And `nullable` allows you to define whether the variable can be null or not."
